## 🔍 Project Overview

**GEUNavEra** is a smart campus navigation web app built using **Python (Flask)**, **C**, **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, and **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** for real-time path visualization. After logging in, users access an interactive map where they can select campus blocks, view details, and get directions using optimized pathfinding algorithms like **Dijkstra**, **A\***, and **Floyd-Warshall**.

The system calculates accurate distances using the **Vincenty formula**, shows walkable steps and estimated time, and displays the route on OSM. A **chatbot assistant** is also included for interactive help.

## 🎬 Usage & Walkthrough

- **Login Page** Enter your credentials to log in  
- **Main Page** Displays a static campus map with clickable blocks. Clicking a block shows related images 
- **Navigation Panel*** Select the algorithm (Dijkstra, Floyd Warshall, or A*), source, and destination using dropdownse  
- **Results Display** Shows total distance (using Vincenty formula), estimated time, and walkable steps.
- **Map Visualization** View the computed route using OpenStreetMap  
- **Chatbot Support** Interact with the assistant for help and navigation queries
